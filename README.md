## Build

The API is a program for deploying development environment containers.\
The parameters required to use the API are as follows.

|    Variable Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :----------: | :--: | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------: |
| projectName | str | - | Project Name |
|  Processor | str | CPU | Processor Allocation Parameters |
|      OS | str | Ubuntu | Development Environment Container Operating System Allocation Parameters |
|     Type | str | Jupiter | Development Environment Container Access Method Allocation Parameters |
|   Password | str | None | Project Distribution Container Password Allocation Parameters |
| databaseList | list | None | Database Container Deployment Allocation Parameters |

<br>

The result is output as shown below.

<br>

The API also specifies the types that it supports.\
The specified type is configured as follows.

| Variable Name | Type | Support Type (Case Check) |
| :------------: | :----: | :----------------------------: |
